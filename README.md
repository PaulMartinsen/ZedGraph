# ZedGraph

*The charting library for .NET*

created by John Champion
customized by Paul Martinsen

forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/zedgraph/

ZedGraph is a class library, user control, and web control for .net, written in C#, for drawing 2D Line, Bar, and Pie Charts. 
It features full, detailed customization capabilities, but most options have defaults for ease of use.

## Customization
* Basic support for cursors. Cursors are horizontal or vertical lines you can add to the 
  graph as guides or reference markers. The user can (optionally) move cursors using the
  mouse. Todo: serialization, labels.
